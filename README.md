 Iâ€™m excited to share a fun and interactive code that I recently createdâ€”a "Guess the Number" game designed to test your intuition and problem-solving skills! ðŸ§ ðŸ”¢
 In this, youâ€™ll see a dynamic and engaging game where participants guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.

User-Friendly Interface: Easily input marks for each subject.
Automatic Grade Calculation: Instantly see overall performance based on the entered marks.
Customizable Weightage: Adjust the importance of each subject as per your requirements.
